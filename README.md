# Call-Center-Dashboard 

# üí† Project Overview
The Call Center Analysis project utilizes Power BI to analyze and evaluate key aspects of call center operations, including total calls, resolution rates, abandoned calls, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.
The analysis highlights patterns in call volume by time and day, identifies top-performing agents, and pinpoints areas needing improvement, such as response times and unresolved issues.
By providing interactive and visually intuitive dashboards, the project equips stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, improve service quality, and enhance customer satisfaction. - This data-driven approach supports better decision-making to address operational challenges effectively.

# üí† Problem Statement:
* How can we reduce the number of abandoned calls and improve the overall call resolution rates?

* Which agents are performing well, and who requires additional support or training to enhance their efficiency?

* What are the key factors contributing to low customer satisfaction ratings, and how can they be addressed?

* Are there specific days or times when call volumes peak?

* How can we optimize response times and workload distribution among agents to improve service quality?

* What topics or issues generate the highest volume of calls, and how can we proactively address them?

* How can insights from this analysis help in resource planning and enhancing the customer experience?

# üí† Data Source
